Title:
🚀 Unlocking Retail Potential with Machine Learning – My Sales Forecasting Project!

Post:
I’m excited to share my latest project where I developed a retail sales forecasting system using time series analysis and machine learning techniques. This project aimed to help businesses better plan inventory, manage demand, and reduce revenue loss.

🔍 Key Objectives:

Forecast future sales with historical data.

Compare and deploy different models for accuracy and interpretability.

🧠 Tech & Tools Used:

Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy)

Models: XGBoost, Prophet, SARIMAX

Evaluation: RMSE, MAE, R²

Dashboarding: Streamlit for model comparison and visualization

Deployment-ready: Models saved using joblib for integration

📈 Outcomes:

XGBoost performed with the best balance of accuracy and interpretability.

Streamlit dashboard allows users to interactively view forecast vs actuals, and select different models.

💡 This project taught me the importance of combining statistical models with ML, and the power of visual storytelling in dashboards.

👉 I’d love to connect with others working in retail analytics, time series, or demand forecasting!
